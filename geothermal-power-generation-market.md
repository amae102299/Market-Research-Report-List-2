<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Geothermal Power Generation Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Back Pressure</li><li>Binary</li><li>Double Flash</li><li>Dry Steam</li><li>Single Flash</li><li>Triple Flash</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Geothermal power generation involves various market types, including Back Pressure, Binary, Double Flash, Dry Steam, Single Flash, and Triple Flash. Back Pressure systems use high-pressure steam to run a turbine and generate power before directing the lower-pressure steam to other uses. Binary systems utilize a secondary fluid with a lower boiling point, which evaporates due to the heat from geothermal wells and drives a turbine. Double Flash systems separate the geothermal fluid into two phases to produce power. Dry Steam systems transfer high-pressure steam directly from underground to the turbine. Single Flash systems separate geothermal fluid into steam and water phases, while Triple Flash systems separate it into three phases to generate power.</p></p>

<p><strong>The Geothermal Power Generation Market Industry Research by Application is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Dry Steam Power Stations</li><li>Flash Steam Power Stations</li><li>Binary Cycle Power Stations</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The geothermal power generation market consists of three main types of power stations: dry steam, flash steam, and binary cycle. Dry steam power stations utilize the steam directly from the underground reservoirs to generate electricity. Flash steam power stations extract high-pressure hot water from the reservoirs, which then rapidly flashes into steam to drive the turbines. Binary cycle power stations utilize a heat exchanger to transfer heat from the geothermal water to a secondary fluid with a lower boiling point, which then drives the turbine. These different applications cater to varying geological conditions and resource availability.</p></p>
