<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The OLED Panel Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Active Matrix</li><li>Passive Matrix</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The OLED panel market can be categorized into two types: active matrix and passive matrix. The active matrix market refers to OLED panels that use thin-film transistors (TFTs) to control the illumination of each pixel. With this technology, each pixel can be individually controlled, allowing for sharper and more vibrant images. On the other hand, the passive matrix market involves OLED panels that use a simpler matrix of electrodes to control the pixels. These panels are less expensive and consume less power, but they may have slower response times and lower image quality compared to active matrix panels.</p></p>
