<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The PU Resins for Artificial Leather Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Dry-process Synthetic Leather</li><li>Wet-process Synthetic Leather</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>PU resins play a crucial role in the manufacturing of artificial leather. Two main types of market for artificial leather are the dry-process and wet-process synthetic leather markets. Dry-process synthetic leather refers to a method where polyurethane resins are directly coated onto a non-woven fabric substrate. This type of synthetic leather is known for its durability and abrasion resistance. On the other hand, wet-process synthetic leather involves applying the PU resin onto a release paper, which is later transferred onto a fabric substrate. This method allows for a wider range of design options and is commonly used for making high-quality artificial leather products.</p></p>
