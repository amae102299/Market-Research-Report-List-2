<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Industrial X-ray Flaw Detection Film Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Non-Screen Type Films</li><li>Screen Type Films</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The Industrial X-ray Flaw Detection Film market encompasses two types of films: Non-Screen Type Films and Screen Type Films. Non-Screen Type Films do not require a separate screen to be used in conjunction with them. They are directly exposed to X-ray radiation, resulting in the formation of an image on the film. On the other hand, Screen Type Films require the use of a separate screen, which converts X-rays into light. This light then exposes the film, creating an image. Both types of films play a crucial role in industrial flaw detection processes.</p></p>
