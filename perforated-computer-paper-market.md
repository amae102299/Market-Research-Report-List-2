<p><strong>The Perforated Computer Paper Market Industry Research by Application is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Dot-matrix Printers</li><li>Line Printers</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Perforated computer paper is widely used in the market for dot-matrix printers and line printers. Dot-matrix printers have a mechanism that strikes an ink-soaked ribbon against the paper, creating characters and images by a series of dots. These printers are commonly used in industries that require carbon copies or multipart forms. Line printers, on the other hand, use a line of hammers or pins to strike against the paper, producing characters at a very high speed. This makes them suitable for high-volume printing, such as in large-scale data processing applications.</p></p>
